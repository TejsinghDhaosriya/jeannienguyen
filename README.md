# Jeannie Nguyen

Hi, I'm Jeannie‚Äîa software engineer who loves to create technology that elevates others and builds community. I'm from the middle of LA and OC, CA.. but my heart belongs to the Bay. üß°&nbsp; I'm a sports enthusiast (currently powerlifting + bouldering), I love discovering new music/artists (send me your favorite albums!), and I geek out on games (like Pok&eacute;mon) + anime (currently watching Demon Slayer).

## My values

üçè&nbsp; Learn fast<br>
‚è©&nbsp; Progress > perfection<br>

## How I work

I work with a beginner's mindset and curiosity. I'm highly motivated to learn as much as I can so that my learning can manifest into creative technology that will make a change. Always thrilled to collaborate with others, the opportunities for growth are infinite!
